### Link_tree__clone

I started this project to organize my links. 
I wanted to create my own version just for fun and more versatility. 
And of course polish my skills and practice what I learned.

I used: 

- SASS 
- HTML5
- JavaScript 

It's not finished yet. But so far I added **Dark Theme and localStorage** 

Will change the **loader** screen and add the logo.
